## Intro

This [sequence diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html#sequence-diagrams) written with Mermaid visually represents
the calls and work being performed in the `MountainRangeMPI` example.

It is designed to help visualize the new model of computation as work is divided among multiple independent processes on multiples nodes to computer in parallel.
The logical coordination between each of the processes is illustrated, but the exact distribution of responsibilities between each process is not illustrated.
Operations already defined in the base `MountainRange` class are simplified or omitted in this diagram.

The code covered by this diagram exists in three separate example files:
* [MountainRangeMPI.hpp](../src/MountainRangeMPI.hpp) (sub-class)
* [MountainRange.hpp](../src/MountainRange.hpp) (base class)
* [mountainsolve.cpp](../src/mountainsolve.cpp) (driver code)
